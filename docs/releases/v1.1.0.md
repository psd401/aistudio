# AI Studio v1.1.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 2026-02-05

AI Studio v1.1.0 transforms the platform from a standalone application into an integration-ready platform. External developers can now build on top of AI Studio through REST APIs, OAuth2 authentication, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) support.

## Headline Features

### API v1 Platform
AI Studio now exposes a REST API for programmatic access to assistants, the context graph, conversations, and async jobs. Authenticated via API keys (`sk-` prefix) or OAuth2 JWT tokens. Rate-limited at 60 requests/minute with sliding window enforcement.

- Full OpenAPI 3.1 spec at `docs/API/v1/openapi.yaml`
- Endpoints for assistants, graph nodes/edges, conversations, and job polling
- Consistent error format across all endpoints

### OAuth2/OIDC Provider
Third-party applications can authenticate users through AI Studio's identity using standard OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE (S256). Tokens are signed with AWS KMS (RS256) in production.

- Admin UI at `/admin/oauth-clients` for registering clients
- Standard OIDC discovery at `/.well-known/openid-configuration`
- Granular scope system covering API, MCP, and OIDC scopes
- Access tokens (15min), refresh tokens (24hr), ID tokens (1hr)

### MCP Server
Connect Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible AI tool to AI Studio. The MCP server exposes 5 tools over streamable HTTP transport:

- **search_decisions** — Query the decision graph
- **capture_decision** — Record structured decisions with context and evidence
- **list_assistants** — Discover available AI assistants
- **execute_assistant** — Run assistants with inputs
- **get_decision_graph** — Navigate decision relationships

### Decision Framework
A structured system for capturing organizational decisions with full context: evidence, constraints, reasoning, alternatives, and outcomes. Decisions form a navigable graph showing how choices connect across time and teams.

### K-12 Content Safety (Guardrails)
Amazon Bedrock Guardrails integration provides content filtering and PII protection across all AI interactions. Topics are set to detect-only mode by default to minimize false positives. Real-time SNS alerts notify administrators of safety violations.

## Integration Capabilities

New documentation guides developers through connecting to AI Studio:

- **[MCP Integration Guide](../guides/mcp-integration.md)** — Cursor and Claude Code configuration
- **[OAuth2 Integration Guide](../guides/oauth-integration.md)** — PKCE flow with code examples
- **[API v1 Quickstart](../guides/api-quickstart.md)** — First API call in minutes

## Developer Experience

### Local Docker Development
New Docker-based local development workflow eliminates the need for AWS credentials during development:

```bash
npm run db:up       # Start PostgreSQL
npm run db:seed     # Create test users
npm run dev:local   # Start Next.js
```

### API Key Management
Users can create and manage API keys from **Settings > API Keys**. Keys use `sk-` prefix, are hashed with Argon2id, and support per-key scopes and rate limits. Max 10 keys per user.

## Platform Upgrades

- **Next.js 16** (from 15) — Updated to 16.1.6
- **AI SDK v6** (from v5) — Updated Vercel AI SDK and all provider packages
- **Drizzle ORM** — Complete migration from RDS Data API to type-safe Drizzle ORM with postgres.js driver
- **React 19.2.4** — Latest React with Compiler support

## Stability Improvements

- Reduced SSE connection error log noise (#747)
- Fixed model-not-found errors during auto-selection (#746)
- Fixed timestamp conversion timezone handling (#745)
- Automatic refresh for expired S3 presigned URLs (#737)
- Reduced Bedrock Guardrails false positive rate (#727, #742)
- Fixed message count reconciliation (#719)
- Resolved React Compiler hook dependency violations (#461)

## Infrastructure

- **GuardrailsStack** — New CDK stack for Bedrock Guardrails, DynamoDB configuration, and SNS alerts
- **Aurora Auto-Pause** — Dev databases scale to 0 ACU when idle (~$44/month savings)
- **VPC Consolidation** — Reduced from 2 VPCs to 1 shared VPC
- **Lambda Power-Tuning** — 66% memory reduction across all functions

## Breaking Changes

| Change | Impact | Migration |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| `documents.conversation_id` → UUID | Existing conversation references | Run migration 010+ files |
| `chatEnabled` column removed | Code referencing this column | Remove column references |
| OAuth token response shape | Existing token consumers | Update to expect `id_token` field |
| API key `sk-` prefix | Existing API keys | Regenerate keys via Settings UI |

## Upgrade Instructions

1. Pull latest code and run `npm install`
2. Run database migrations: `npm run db:migrate`
3. Deploy GuardrailsStack (new): `cd infra && npx cdk deploy AIStudio-GuardrailsStack-Dev`
4. Deploy remaining stacks: `npx cdk deploy --all`
5. Verify guardrails SSM parameters exist
6. Regenerate API keys if using the old format
