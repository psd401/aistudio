# Agent-Owned Google Workspace Integration (#912)

Per-user agents operate as their own Google Workspace identity
(`agnt_<uniqname>@psd401.net`). Humans delegate to the agent the same way
they would delegate to a real executive assistant. The agent's
`psd-workspace` skill wraps the `gws` CLI and obtains per-session access
tokens for two slots:

- **User slot (`--scope user`)** — the human's own identity. Still uses a
  per-user OAuth **consent** flow; the refresh token lives in Secrets Manager
  and is exchanged for an access token at runtime.
- **Agent slot (`--scope agent`)** — the `agnt_*` identity. As of **#1232**
  there is **no consent flow and no stored refresh token**: a short-lived
  access token is minted on demand by a **domain-wide-delegation (DWD) token
  broker** (`POST /api/agent/workspace-token`). Agent accounts are created
  automatically via the OneSync sheet (**#1233**); interactive sign-in on
  `agnt_*` accounts is blocked at the Google layer.
  - **Confused-deputy isolation (#1232 hardening):** the DWD broker and the
    OneSync sheet writer do **not** run in the Next.js app. They run in a
    dedicated **mint Lambda** (`psd-agent-mint-{env}`) with its own least-
    privilege role, which is the **sole AWS principal the Google WIF provider
    trusts**. The `/api/agent/workspace-token` and `/api/agent/account-request`
    routes are thin proxies that reach the mint Lambda via an IAM-authed
    `lambda:InvokeFunction`. So a frontend RCE/SSRF can at most *invoke* the mint
    Lambda — which always derives `agnt_<owner>` server-side — and can never
    reach the WIF credential to `signJwt(sub=<arbitrary human>)`. Blast radius of
    a frontend compromise: **any `agnt_` account** (agent-generated content), not
    any psd401.net mailbox. (When `AGENT_MINT_LAMBDA_NAME` is unset — local dev —
    the routes run the broker in-process; there is no real WIF locally.)

## Components

| Layer | Where | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| DB | `psd_agent_workspace_tokens`, `psd_agent_workspace_consent_nonces` (migration 071) | Token manifest (user slot lifecycle; agent slot shows "Auto (DWD)") + one-time consent nonces |
| API | `POST /api/agent/consent-link` | Agent→app, mints signed consent URLs (**user slot only** — agent_account is rejected, #1232) |
| API | `POST /api/agent/workspace-token` | Agent→app; **thin proxy** to the mint Lambda; mints a ~1h agent-slot access token (#1232). 404 `account-not-provisioned` when the agnt_ account isn't made yet |
| API | `POST /api/agent/account-request` | Router→app; **thin proxy** to the mint Lambda (probe + OneSync `agents` sheet append) to auto-provision the agnt_ account (#1233) |
| Lambda | `psd-agent-mint-{env}` (AgentPlatformStack, role `psd-agent-mint-execution-role-{env}`) | **#1232 isolation** — the sole WIF principal. Houses the DWD broker + provisioning-sheet writer; derives `agnt_<owner>` server-side. Role grants only `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` on `psd-agent/{env}/*` + logs; the frontend holds only `lambda:InvokeFunction` on it. |
| UI | `/agent-connect`, `/agent-connect/callback` | Public OAuth bootstrap (off-nav) |
| Admin | "Workspace" tab in `/admin/agents` | Per-user status dashboard |
| Skill | `infra/agent-image/skills/psd-workspace/` | Agent-side `gws` wrapper |
| Workflow skill | `infra/agent-image/skills/psd-workflows/` | Dynamically discovers the PSD Agent Gateway MCP roster, describes schemas, and calls owner-bound workflows (#1403) |
| Binary | `gws` (pinned in `Dockerfile`) | Google Workspace CLI |
| Upstream skills | `gws-gmail`, `gws-calendar`, `gws-sheets`, … (cloned at image build, same tag as the binary) | Per-API guidance for the agent |
| Rules | `infra/agent-image/skills/psd-rules/SKILL.md` | Tier 1 progressive-disclosure rules (think silently, never fabricate URLs/memory, no empty promises, Chat formatting) |
| Formatter | `infra/agent-image/chat_format.py` | Markdown → Google Chat transform applied at the harness boundary |
| Secrets | `psd-agent/{env}/google-oauth-client`, `psd-agent/{env}/internal-api-key`, `psd-agent/{env}/gcp-dwd-config` (#1232/#1233), `psd-agent/{env}/agent-gateway` (#1230/#1403), `psd-agent-creds/{env}/user/{email}/google-workspace-user` (user slot) | OAuth client, PSK, GCP DWD config JSON, dynamic workflow-gateway URL+token JSON, per-user refresh tokens. The agent slot no longer stores a refresh token (#1232). |
| DWD config | `psd-agent/{env}/gcp-dwd-config` JSON: `{projectNumber, wifPoolId, wifProviderId, serviceAccountEmail, provisioningSheetId}` (Secrets Manager, IT-supplied; env-var overrides for local dev) | Keyless WIF → service-account impersonation for the broker + OneSync provisioning-sheet id. Read lazily (5-min cached); broker fails closed until populated. |
| Cedar | `psd-agent-governance.cedar` | Allowlists for oauth2.googleapis.com + n8n gateway (`n8n.psd401.net/mcp/*`, #1230) + consent-link + workspace-token + account-request, secret.read on `psd-agent/*` |

## Bootstrap flow — user slot (consent)

1. User DMs agent with a request needing THEIR mailbox/calendar (`--scope user`).
2. Skill checks Secrets Manager for a per-user refresh token; finds none.
3. Skill POSTs `/api/agent/consent-link` (`kind:"user_account"`) with a
   shared-secret Bearer.
4. App signs a JWT (`AUTH_SECRET`, 24h exp, single-use nonce) and returns a URL.
5. Skill emits `{status:"needs-auth",consent_url,...}` and exits 10.
6. Agent pastes the URL verbatim into Chat; user clicks; `/agent-connect`
   verifies the JWT and redirects to Google (with `hd=psd401.net`).
7. Google redirects back to `/agent-connect/callback?code=...&state=<nonce>`.
8. Callback re-verifies the nonce, exchanges the code, **verifies the granted
   id_token's email matches the owner** (#1234 — a wrong-account grant stores
   nothing and is retryable), writes the refresh token to
   `psd-agent-creds/{env}/user/{email}/google-workspace-user`, upserts the
   manifest row `active`, and consumes the nonce.
9. User retries. Skill fetches the token, refreshes it, and execs `gws`.

## Agent-slot flow — DWD broker (no consent)

1. User asks the agent to act AS itself (`--scope agent`).
2. Skill POSTs `/api/agent/workspace-token` (`{ownerEmail}`, PSK Bearer).
3. The route (thin proxy) invokes the **mint Lambda**, which derives
   `agnt_<owner-localpart>@psd401.net` server-side and mints a ~1h access token
   via WIF → service-account signJwt → jwt-bearer exchange. Only the mint
   Lambda's role can perform the WIF leg (the frontend cannot).
4. If the agnt_ account doesn't exist yet, the mint Lambda returns 404
   `account-not-provisioned`; the skill emits `{status:"account-provisioning"}`
   exit 14 (the router has already kicked off auto-provisioning, #1233). No
   consent link — the user just retries in ~30 min.

Outbound Google Chat messages are agent-slot-only. The trusted executor
allowlists both the `chat +send` helper and the raw
`chat spaces messages create` method, while rejecting both on the human user
slot. The DWD assertion already carries `chat.messages`, which authorizes
`spaces.messages.create` with user authentication; `chat.bot` is for Chat-app
authentication and is not the credential mode used by the `agnt_*` identity.
The skill still requires explicit user confirmation before posting, and the
broker refuses Chat message creation from scheduled invocation mode, where no
live confirmation can exist. Scheduled job output continues through the
router's existing configured delivery path rather than calling `chat +send`.

The destination is bounded by Chat membership rather than by the turn that
triggered the send. The agent cannot widen that boundary itself: `chat spaces
create`, `chat spaces setup` and `chat spaces members create` are all absent
from the write allowlist, so the reachable set is the spaces the `agnt_*`
identity already belongs to. Completed interactive sends are logged with their
resolved destination space and message length (never the body) so posts are
auditable after the fact.

## Runtime error contract

The skill emits a single JSON line on stdout (or a stderr message for exit 12)
and a non-zero exit code when auth isn't ready:

| Exit | Status | Slot | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | `needs-auth` | user | No refresh token yet — consent URL in payload |
| 11 | `token-revoked` | user | `invalid_grant` from Google — consent URL in payload |
| 12 | (stderr) | agent | Transport error reaching the broker/Google (transient) |
| 13 | `phase1-forbidden` | both | A Phase-1 hard gate refused the command |
| 14 | `account-provisioning` | agent | agnt_ account being auto-created — retry later, nothing to click |

User-slot 10/11 payloads carry `consent_url`; `SOUL.md` instructs the agent to
paste it verbatim into Chat and stop the turn. Exit 14 carries **no** URL.

## Deployment checklist

1. **GCP Console** (one-time): create the OAuth client per the Epic spec —
   Internal + In Production, redirect URIs for dev and prod, all seven
   scopes.
2. Populate Secrets Manager:
   ```bash
   aws secretsmanager put-secret-value \
     --secret-id psd-agent/dev/google-oauth-client \
     --secret-string '{"client_id":"...","client_secret":"..."}'
   ```
3. The internal API key is auto-generated by CDK. Capture it into the
   Next.js app's `AGENT_INTERNAL_API_KEY` env var so the app can authenticate
   incoming skill requests.
4. Set `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLIENT_SECRET` in the
   Next.js environment (same values as step 2).
5. **DWD broker + provisioning (#1232/#1233)** — IT provisions a Google service
   account with domain-wide delegation + a workload-identity-federation trust,
   then populate ONE Secrets Manager secret (no CDK context flags — aistudio is a
   public repo):
   ```bash
   aws secretsmanager create-secret \
     --name psd-agent/dev/gcp-dwd-config \
     --tags Key=Environment,Value=dev Key=ManagedBy,Value=aistudio \
     --secret-string '{"projectNumber":"…","wifPoolId":"…","wifProviderId":"…","serviceAccountEmail":"…@….iam.gserviceaccount.com","provisioningSheetId":"…"}'
   ```
   The mint Lambda reads it lazily (5-min cached); until it exists the broker
   fails closed (503 / `not-configured`) and provisioning is skipped. (Local dev
   may instead set the `GCP_*` / `AGENT_PROVISIONING_SHEET_ID` env vars.)

   **WIF trusts the mint role, NOT the frontend role (#1232 hardening).** The WIF
   provider condition and the SA `principalSet` bindings must reference the mint
   Lambda's role, whose ARN is stable and deterministic:
   - Role ARN: `arn:aws:iam::<account>:role/psd-agent-mint-execution-role-{env}`
   - Assumed-role principal (what Google's STS sees): `arn:aws:sts::<account>:assumed-role/psd-agent-mint-execution-role-{env}/*`

   Reese, when wiring (or re-pointing off the old frontend-role trust) the
   Google side against the mint role:
   1. Set the WIF provider (`mint-service`) attribute condition to accept the
      mint role's assumed-role ARN above (replacing the frontend ECS task role).
   2. Move the `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` **and**
      `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` `principalSet` bindings on the DWD
      service account to the mint role's WIF principal.

   The mint Lambda authenticates keylessly (google-auth-library `AwsClient`
   resolves the Lambda role's ambient credentials via the Fargate/Lambda
   container-credentials endpoint the same way it did for the ECS task role — see
   the `credential_source` note in `lib/agent-workspace/gcp-wif.ts`); no
   service-account key is downloaded.
6. **Agent workflow gateway (#1230/#1403)** — populate ONE JSON secret with
   both the n8n MCP Server Trigger URL and its bearer token (again, no CDK
   context flag):
   ```bash
   aws secretsmanager create-secret \
     --name psd-agent/dev/agent-gateway \
     --tags Key=Environment,Value=dev Key=ManagedBy,Value=aistudio \
     --secret-string '{"url":"https://n8n.psd401.net/mcp/…/sse","token":"…"}'
   ```
   The `psd-workflows` skill discovers the gateway's live MCP `tools/list`
   roster through the signed web broker; an absent/incomplete secret → exit 11
   `not-configured`. Every gateway parameter that represents the verified
   caller must be a top-level string property actually consumed by the workflow
   and include `[caller-bound]` in that property's `inputSchema` description.
   The broker replaces all marked values with the signed owner. Only lowercase
   `get_*` and `list_*` names are treated as read-only; every other tool fails
   closed without a marker, regardless of case or naming style. For one release,
   `list_supervised_employees.evaluator_email` and
   `submit_classified_evaluation.evaluator_email` are also owner-bound
   explicitly so older gateway schemas remain safe during the marker rollout.
7. Deploy infra (AgentPlatformStack + FrontendStack) and the new agent image. No
   `-c` context flags are needed for the gateway or DWD config.
8. **Remediation (one-off, run manually):**
   - `scripts/agent-workspace/purge-agent-slot-tokens.ts` — delete all
     agent-slot refresh tokens (retired by the broker; one is known to hold a
     human's token). Dry-run by default; `--apply` to execute.
   - `scripts/agent-workspace/audit-user-slot-token-identity.ts` — audit
     user-slot tokens for identity mismatch (#1234) and purge the bad ones.

## Delegation (user-side)

Once connected, users who want the agent to act on *their* inbox/calendar
delegate from Gmail/Calendar settings to `agnt_<uniqname>@psd401.net`.
Without delegation, the agent only sees its own inbox/calendar.

## Limits (explicit)

- **No automated Gmail/Calendar delegation** — users do it via Google's UI.
- **No progressive scope consent** — v1 grants all scopes at bootstrap.
- **No agent-to-agent workspace actions** — deferred.
- **Missing-scope exit (12) is reserved** — `gws` does not currently emit
  structured missing-scope errors; revocation (11) is the primary
  re-consent path.
